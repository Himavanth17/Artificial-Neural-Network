1. Import Libraries
    
    ```python
    
    import pandas as pd
    import tensorflow as tf
    import numpy as np
    
    ```
    
    - pandas: Used to handle and analyze data easily.
    - tensorflow: A tool to build and train machine learning models.
    - numpy: Used to work with arrays (tables of numbers).
2. Load the Data
    
    ```python
    
    df = pd.read_csv('Churn_Modelling.csv')
    
    ```
    
    - pd.read_csv: Reads data from a CSV file and stores it in a DataFrame called `df`.
3. Select Features and Labels
    
    ```python
    
    x = df.iloc[:, 3:13]
    y = df.iloc[:, 13]
    
    ```
    
    - x: Contains the features (columns 3 to 12) that help predict churn.
    - y: Contains the label (column 13) that indicates if a customer churned (1) or not (0).
4. Encode Categorical Data
    
    ```python
    
    from sklearn.preprocessing import LabelEncoder
    le = LabelEncoder()
    x.iloc[:, 2] = le.fit_transform(x.iloc[:, 2])
    
    ```
    
    - LabelEncoder: Converts categorical data (like country names) into numbers. Here, it converts the "Gender" column (at index 2).
5. One-Hot Encoding
    
    ```python
    
    from sklearn.compose import ColumnTransformer
    from sklearn.preprocessing import OneHotEncoder
    ct = ColumnTransformer(transformers=[('encoder', OneHotEncoder(), [1])], remainder='passthrough')
    x = np.array(ct.fit_transform(x))
    
    ```
    
    - OneHotEncoder: Converts categorical data into a format that can be used by the model. Here, it converts the "Geography" column (at index 1).
    - ColumnTransformer: Applies the OneHotEncoder to the specified column and keeps the rest of the data unchanged.
    - np.array: Converts the result back to a numpy array.
6. Split Data into Training and Testing Sets
    
    ```python
    
    from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
    x_train, x_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(x, y, test_size=0.25, random_state=0)
    
    ```
    
    - train_test_split: Splits the data into training and testing sets. 75% of the data is used for training, and 25% is used for testing.
7. Feature Scaling
    
    ```python
    
    from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
    sc = StandardScaler()
    x_train = sc.fit_transform(x_train)
    x_test = sc.transform(x_test)
    
    ```
    
    - StandardScaler: Scales the data so that it has a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1. This helps the model learn better.
8. Build the ANN
    
    ```python
    
    ann = tf.keras.models.Sequential()
    ann.add(tf.keras.layers.Dense(units=6, activation='relu'))
    ann.add(tf.keras.layers.Dense(units=6, activation='relu'))
    ann.add(tf.keras.layers.Dense(units=1, activation='sigmoid'))
    
    ```
    
    - Sequential: Defines a sequence of layers for the ANN.
    - Dense: Adds fully connected layers to the ANN.
        - units=6: Number of neurons in the layer.
        - activation='relu': Activation function for the neurons (Rectified Linear Unit).
        - The first two layers have 6 neurons each with the 'relu' activation function.
        - The last layer has 1 neuron with the 'sigmoid' activation function (used for binary classification).
9. Compile the ANN
    
    ```python
    
    ann.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='binary_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])
    
    ```
    
    - optimizer='adam': Optimizer that adjusts the weights of the neurons to reduce the error.
    - loss='binary_crossentropy': Loss function used for binary classification.
    - metrics=['accuracy']: Measures the accuracy of the model during training and testing.
10. Train the ANN
    
    ```python
    
    ann.fit(x_train, y_train, batch_size=32, epochs=100)
    
    ```
    
    - fit: Trains the ANN on the training data.
    - batch_size=32: Number of samples the model looks at before updating the weights.
    - epochs=100: Number of times the model looks at the entire training data.

### Summary

This code loads customer data, processes it, and uses an artificial neural network to predict customer churn. It involves encoding categorical data, scaling features, building and compiling the ANN, and training the model on the data.
